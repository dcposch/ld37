### [DEMO: https://feross.net/netflixandkill.club](https://feross.net/netflixandkill.club)

## quick start

```
npm run build
npm start
```

then, go to `localhost:4000`

## ideas

- last stand: fps inside a room, invaders coming from outside
- butterfly escape: you're a butterfly in a greenhouse who wants to be free
- bullet hell: you're in a room, enemies keep showing up and raining bullets, you have to dodge and shoot back. maybe the room looks kind of like a portal test chamber, and the conveyor belt keeps bringing new killbots
